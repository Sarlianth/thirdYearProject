# Third Year  Project

IrishBusApp is the project whose objective is to make the bus ticket reservation online so that user can book ticket from their own place. I am making this project in Java GUI. I am using local server to host the database of IrishBusApp. You can also use any online server to host the database. I use MySQL database for this project.
